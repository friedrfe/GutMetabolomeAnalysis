{"cells":[{"source":"# Inflammatory Bowel Disease Classification & Analysis based on Gut Metabolomic Data\n\nThe notebook is also available on [github](https://github.com/friedrfe/GutMicrobiomeAnalysis). There you can retrieve the interactive plots for the dimension reduction since the herein used workspace doesn't support them yet.  \n\nThe goal of the project is to present an analysis of clinical data by leveraging a multitude of computational approaches. The objectives of the analysis are the sensitive prediction of sick patients using machinge learning (ML) and the possible identification of new biomarkers for inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) by using the feature importance of the ML models and/or differential expression analysis.\n\nThis project is based on high-dimensional data obtained by mass spectrometry (MS). Here, different dimensionality reduction and machine learning (ML) methods will be used and discussed. The script is divided in several sections, starting with data wrangling, followed by exploratory data analysis. Different methods are used for dimension reduction with subsequent classification from a variety of ML models. Finally, the results will be discussed. Moreover, a differential expression analysis is planned. \n\n## Imports \nA variety of packages are required for the diverse ML methods. The main framework is [tidymodels](https://www.tmwr.org/) and the many [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/) principles are used.\n","metadata":{},"id":"ac93eed1-0e8f-44e4-9059-b105c369df04","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"install.packages(\"rlang\")\ninstall.packages(\"readxl\", quiet = TRUE)\ninstall.packages(\"nloptr\", quiet = TRUE)\ninstall.packages(c(\"rpart\", \"xgboost\", \"rstanarm\", \"lme4\"), quiet = TRUE)\ninstall.packages(\"embed\", quiet = TRUE)\ninstall.packages(\"BiocManager\", suppressUpdates=TRUE, quiet = TRUE)\nBiocManager::install('mixOmics', update = FALSE)\ninstall.packages(\"ranger\", quiet = TRUE)\ninstall.packages(\"vip\", quiet = TRUE)\ninstall.packages(\"stacks\", quiet = TRUE)\ninstall.packages(\"kernlab\", quiet = TRUE)\ninstall.packages(\"xgboost\", quiet = TRUE)\ninstall.packages(\"kknn\", quiet = TRUE)\ninstall.packages(\"glmnet\", quiet = TRUE)\ninstall.packages(\"plsmod\", quiet = TRUE)\ninstall.packages(\"tictoc\", quiet = TRUE)\ninstall.packages(\"Rtsne\", quiet = TRUE)\ninstall.packages(\"plotly\", quiet = TRUE)\ninstall.packages(\"tidymodels\", force = TRUE, quiet = TRUE)\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\", quiet = TRUE)\ninstall.packages(\"cowplot\", quiet = TRUE)\ninstall.packages(\"visdat\", quiet = TRUE)\ninstall.packages(\"plotly\", quiet = TRUE)\ninstall.packages(\"tictoc\", quiet = TRUE)\ninstall.packages(\"gtools\", quiet = TRUE)","metadata":{},"cell_type":"code","id":"4be90e10-7f7f-4eb0-b221-390df9aa7a5c","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"source":"suppressPackageStartupMessages({library(mixOmics, quietly = TRUE)\nlibrary(plsmod)\nlibrary(readxl, quietly = TRUE)\nlibrary(vip, quietly = TRUE)\nlibrary(tictoc, quietly = TRUE)\nlibrary(stacks, quietly = TRUE)\nlibrary(MASS,exclude = \"select\")\nlibrary(Rtsne, quietly = TRUE)\nlibrary(tidyverse, quietly = TRUE)\nlibrary(tidymodels, quietly = TRUE)\nlibrary(plotly, quietly = TRUE)\nlibrary(embed, quietly = TRUE)\nlibrary(gtools, quietly = TRUE)\nlibrary(cowplot, quietly = TRUE)\nlibrary(visdat, quietly = TRUE)\n})\n","metadata":{},"id":"6c398ce2-e226-43ce-afbe-f4d0d1c7a937","cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"source":"## Initial Data Analysis\n\n### The data\nThe data set can be retrieved from the supplementary material from the [published study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6342642/bin/NIHMS1510763-supplement-Dataset_2.xlsx). Untargeted metabolomic profiling of stool samples from patients with Crohn’s disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), and non-inflammatory bowel disease control (IBD) patients was performed in the study of [E. A. Franzosa et al.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6342642/) Previous studies have found differences in faecal metabolite composition in IBD patients.\\\nIn their study metabolomic and shotgun metagenomic profiling was conducted, and in this analysis only the metabolomic features derived by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) will be considered. The data set includes untargeted metabolomic profiles of stool samples from a 155-member discovery cohort and a 65-member independent validation cohort. Four different LC-MS methods were used to cover different metabolites classes like polar metabolites, lipids, free fatty acids, and bile acids. 3829 uncharacterized metabolite features were assigned to putative molecular classed based on comparison to the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) and 566 features were annotated by reference from an in-house compound library. Also, metabolites were clustered based on their covariation across samples. The discovery cohort includes 68 CD, 53 UC, and 34 non-IBD patients.

Most ML methods require the absence of NA values or remove them on their own. There are different ways to handle missing values. The two primary solutions are deletion or imputation.

The latter might be necessary if many values are missing for one variable. In contrast, there are many options to impute missing values. This ranges from using simple statistics like mean or median to using methods like regression or ML methods like the *k*-nearest neighbors algorithm. \nFirst, the columns with NA values will be visualized using the `visdat` package to find some possible relationships or causes of the missing data.

Because of “the curse of dimensionality,” the volume of the data increases so fast with additional dimensions (variables) that the data becomes sparse. This phenomenon can result in a loss of accuracy of ML models. DR can be beneficial for the majority of modern biological datasets, in which the data often contain measurements on uninformative or redundant variables. For example, redundant variables from overlapping peaks or compounds found in more than one LC-MS setup.\\\n\\\nDR can be viewed as a method for latent variable extraction and is also frequently used for data compression, exploration, visualization, and data pre-processing for ML. There is no best technique for dimensionality reduction. Instead, the choice depends on the nature of the data and the intended purpose. In the case of ML, the best DR method could be chosen on the basis of the performance of the resulting model. \\\n\\\nThere a multitude of dimensional reduction algorithms which can reduce the dimensions and allow for visualization in the two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) space. Those techniques can also be divided into linear and non-linear transformations. The most common linear transformation is the principal component analysis (PCA). PCA can also be extended with the kernel trick to kernel PCA (kPCA), which allows for non-linear separable data to be separated in a higher-dimensional space. Both methods allow for the application of the learnt mapping function to unseen test data. More examples of non-linear transformations are t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE) and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP). \n\n#### *t*-Distributed Stochastic neighbor Embedding \n*t*-SNE is used for visualization of high-dimensional data which can be projected into the low-dimensional space. Thereby, similar objects are modelled by nearby points and dissimilar objects by distant points with high probability. The visual appearance is influenced by hyperparameters, where perplexity is the most important. Perplexity is comparable to the nearest neighbours hyperparameter. Lower values tend to spread out the projected data and higher values tend to preserve the global structure. \\\n\\\nLarger and denser data sets require a higher perplexity which requires longer computational time. Typical values range from 5 to 50. *t*-SNE learns a non-parametric mapping and not an explicit function. Therefore, it is not possible to directly embed test data into an existing map, which is crucial for supervised machine learning. However, it would be possible to fit a multivariate regression model between the original data and the embedded dimensions. Thus, *t*-SNE is rather used for visualization purposes than for pre-processing for ML.\\\n\\\nHerein, different parameters of perplexity are used and visualized in the two-dimensional space. The model was trained with the whole data set, including the discovery and validation group.\n","metadata":{},"id":"8f297080-35a4-46e4-b43c-dd2f479331ed","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"data_tsne <- tibble(perplexity = c(5, 10, 15, 30, 45))\ndata_tsne <- data_tsne %>% mutate(TSNE = map(perplexity, ~Rtsne(data_combined_train, dims=2, PCA=F, perplexity=.x, max_iter=2000)))\n\nfor (i in 1:nrow(data_tsne)){\n  x = data_tsne$perplexity[[i]]\nassign(paste0(\"tsne_df_tune_\", x),\n       tibble(\n              X = data_tsne$TSNE[[i]]$Y[,1],\n              Y = data_tsne$TSNE[[i]]$Y[,2],\n              #Z = data_tsne$TSNE[[i]]$Y[,3],\n              Perplexity = data_tsne$perplexity[[i]],\n              Diagnosis = data_combined$Diagnosis,\n              Cohort = data_combined$Cohort,\n              ID = data_combined$PatientID\n             )\n      )\n}\n","metadata":{},"id":"f92ab525-2252-4265-af74-a4196da024d4","cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"source":"\n\n","metadata":{},"id":"4ece012d-7063-492a-9ad9-ca19b1ec7362","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"list_tsne_tune <- ls(pattern = \"tsne_df_tune_\")\ntsne_combined <- bind_rows(mget(ls(pattern = \"tsne_df_tune_\")))\n\ntsne_combined %>% \nplot_ly(x = ~X, y = ~Y, frame = ~Perplexity, color = ~Diagnosis, symbol = ~Cohort,\n        colors = \"Set1\", type=\"scatter\", mode=\"markers\", ids=~ID,  text = ~paste0(\"Sample: \", ID, \"<br>\",\n                                                                                  \"Diagnosis: \", Diagnosis),\n        hoverinfo = \"text\",\n        marker = list(sizemode = \"diameter\")) %>%\n\nlayout(xaxis = list(showgrid = F,\n                    zeroline = F\n                   ),\n       yaxis = list(showgrid = F,\n                    zeroline = F\n                   )\n       ) %>%\nanimation_opts(\n    redraw=FALSE,\n    frame = 2000,\n    transition = 500) %>%\n\nanimation_slider(\n     currentvalue = list(\n       prefix = \"Perplexity: \", \n       font = list(color = \"red\")))\n","metadata":{},"id":"b0a095ff-1727-4eaa-b17d-9fc8e7beaccf","cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"source":"Note: The interactive visualization is not supported in this workspace yet. The interactive version can be seen [here](https://rpubs.com/friedrfe96/888464). \\\n\\\nThe *t*-SNE dimension reduction has been performed with different values of the perplexity parameter. The coordinate values are in different ranges for the different perplexity settings and can be autoscales in the top-right corner. \nThe individuals (samples) are divided into the discovery and validation groups and the three different cohorts. The objective of the approach is to segment the patients with different diagnoses (colors). \\\n\\\nHerein, all methods with different perplexity parameters segmented the patients into three cluster to some extent. However, in all setups patients with different diagnoses are found in one cluster. This intertwining exposes some possible effects in the subsequent analysis steps. First, some patients with dissimilar diagnoses could have very similar metabolic characteristics. Moreover, the exact differentiation of patients could be impaired by ML methods and differential expression analysis.\nBased on visual assessment the perplexity value of 30 yielded the best separation of patients. Patients with CD and UC seem to more intertwined and hence could possess similar disease characteristics. The cluster of the control group is penetrated by patients with CD and UC, but no control patients are found in the clusters of the CD and UC patients, exept one control patient in the CD cluster. \\\n\\\nThe largest detriement of *t*-SNE is the inabilty as preprocessing method for supervised learning since no mapping function is calculated, which could be applied to the test or validation set. Therefore, other dimension reduction methods are used in the subsequent steps. \n\n\n#### Principial component analyis and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection \n\nFirst, PCA is linear transformation that transforms a large set of variables into a smaller set (principal components) and retains as much information (variability) as possible. After standardization , the eigenvalues and eigenvectors are determined from the covariance matrix in order to derive the principal components (PCs). These are new variables constructed as linear combinations so that as much as possible variability is squeezed into the first PC (PC1). The second PC (PC2) holds the second largest amount of variability orthogonal (uncorrelated) to PC1. \\\n\\\nPCA outputs the similar amount of PCs as input variables. For dimension reduction, a cutoff value, e.g. 0.9, can be chosen at which as much as PCs are chosen to retain the desired amount of information. This also applies to kPCA, which is more suited for non-linear DR. In contrast to PCA, the data is transformed into a higher-dimensional space before covariance matrix calculation. Using the kernel-trick, much computation is avoided since the coordinates of the data don't need to be calculated. \\\n\\\nSimilar to *t*-SNE UMAP employs graph layout algorithms. A high-dimensional graph layout is constructed of the data and then a low-dimensional graph is fitted to be as structually similar as possible. Two common parameters are `n-neighbors` and `min_dist`. They control the balance between local and global structure. Low values of `n-neighbors` leads to a more local structure, whereas a higher value represents a more big-picture structure while losing more fine details. `min_dist` controls how tight the points are packed together. Lower values brings points more together and allow for more clustering. In contrast, larger values will preserve more of the broader topological structure. Moreover, the algorithms allows for both unsupervised and supervised DR. Herein, the latter will be used. \n\n\nIn contrast to *t*-SNE, the hyperparameters were selected based on the best area under the curve of the receiver opererater characteristic (AUROC) score of a cross-validated ML classification model. Moreover, the optimal number of dimensions for classification were also be determined by cross-validation in a separate script using [tidymodels](https://www.tmwr.org/). Three different kinds of ML models were used for each DR algorithm such as KNN, SVM, and a single-layer neural network.\nUMAP and kPCA hyperparamters were tuned with a single-layer neural network with AUROC scores of 0.80 and 0.87, respectively. The number of principal components in PCA were selected based on the Radial basis function SVM (RBF-SVM) classifier with a AUROC score of 0.88.\n","metadata":{},"id":"dbac6fa8-4a7e-44bc-ad8c-e8b22cb64eb7","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"set.seed(42)\nrecipe_umap <- recipe(Diagnosis~., data = train_df) %>%\n  step_normalize(all_numeric_predictors()) %>%\n  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) %>%\n  step_umap(all_predictors(), outcome = vars(Diagnosis), num_comp = 6, min_dist = 0.94396076, learn_rate = 6.193164e-03)\n\nset.seed(42)\nrecipe_kpca <- recipe(Diagnosis~., data = train_df) %>%\n  step_normalize(all_numeric_predictors()) %>%\n  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) %>%\n  step_kpca_rbf(all_predictors(), num_comp = 61, sigma = 1.782724e-06)\n\nset.seed(42)\nrecipe_pca <- recipe(Diagnosis~., data = train_df) %>%\n  step_normalize(all_numeric_predictors()) %>%\n  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) %>%\n  step_pca(all_predictors(), num_comp = 60)\n\ntrain_umap <- bake(recipe_umap %>% prep(), train_df)\ntrain_kpca <- bake(recipe_kpca %>% prep(), train_df)\ntrain_pca <- bake(recipe_pca %>% prep(), train_df)\n\ntest_umap <- bake(recipe_umap %>% prep(), test_df)\ntest_kpca <- bake(recipe_kpca %>% prep(), test_df)\ntest_pca <- bake(recipe_pca %>% prep(), test_df)\n","metadata":{},"id":"71023aaa-0c36-4e35-9bb5-014b73fdc302","cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"source":"\n\n","metadata":{},"id":"da9b358d-8c06-4e59-aafa-cb51e8269ce4","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"train_1 <- train_umap %>% select(UMAP = UMAP1, Diagnosis) %>%\nadd_column(PC = train_pca$PC01) %>%\nadd_column(kPC = train_kpca$kPC01)\n\ntrain_2 <- train_umap %>% select(UMAP2) %>%\nadd_column(PatientID = data_prism_formatted$PatientID) %>%\nadd_column(PC = train_pca$PC02) %>%\nadd_column(kPC = train_kpca$kPC02)\n\ntest_1 <- test_umap %>% select(UMAP = UMAP1) %>%\nadd_column(Diagnosis = test_df_truth$Diagnosis) %>%\nadd_column(kPC = test_kpca$kPC01) %>%\nadd_column(PC = test_pca$PC01)\n\ntest_2 <- test_umap %>% select(UMAP = UMAP2) %>%\nadd_column(PatientID = data_validate_formatted$PatientID) %>%\nadd_column(kPC = test_kpca$kPC02) %>%\nadd_column(PC = test_pca$PC02)\n","metadata":{},"id":"1459c9fc-e9fa-49a3-86d7-751ff94dd97f","cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"source":"\n\n","metadata":{},"id":"ec8588ba-7be1-4118-ab19-e57644f50021","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"train_combined <- train_1 %>% pivot_longer(!Diagnosis, names_to = \"Preprocessing\", values_to = \"Dim1\") %>%\nadd_column(train_2 %>% pivot_longer(!PatientID,names_to = \"Preprocessing\", values_to = \"Dim2\") %>%\n           select(Dim2, PatientID)) %>%\nmutate(Diagnosis = factor(Diagnosis, levels = c(1,2,3), labels = c(\"Control\",\"CD\", \"UC\")))\n\ntest_combined <- test_1 %>% pivot_longer(!Diagnosis, names_to = \"Preprocessing\", values_to = \"Dim1\") %>%\nadd_column(test_2 %>% pivot_longer(!PatientID,names_to = \"Preprocessing\", values_to = \"Dim2\") %>%\n           select(Dim2, PatientID)) %>%\nmutate(Diagnosis = factor(Diagnosis, levels = c(1,2,3), labels = c(\"Control\",\"CD\", \"UC\")))\n\ncombined <- train_combined %>% bind_rows(test_combined, .id = c(\"Group\")) %>%\nmutate(Group = case_when(Group==1 ~ \"Discovery\",\n                         TRUE ~ \"Validate\"))\nhead(combined)\n","metadata":{},"id":"8834f67a-ce99-4625-86f7-9807432bc783","cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"source":"\n\n","metadata":{},"id":"5d61dd38-b959-4527-923d-8c7570b340ab","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"combined %>% \nplot_ly(x = ~Dim1, y = ~Dim2, frame = ~Preprocessing, color = ~Diagnosis, symbol = ~Group,\n        colors = \"Set1\", type=\"scatter\", mode=\"markers\") %>%\n\nlayout(xaxis = list(showgrid = F,\n                    zeroline = F,\n                    autorange = T\n                   ),\n       yaxis = list(showgrid = F,\n                    zeroline = F,\n                    autorange = T\n                   )\n       ) %>%\nanimation_opts(\n    redraw=FALSE,\n    frame = 2000,\n    transition = 500) %>%\n\nanimation_slider(\n     currentvalue = list(\n       prefix = \"Preprocessing: \", \n       font = list(color = \"red\")))\n","metadata":{},"id":"fabc75a1-90ed-48d7-aa8e-58a1bf401a75","cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"source":"In contrast to *t*-SNE, the data was split into the discovery group for training the mapping functions and the validation group to which the mapping function was applied.

Since more than 2 dimensions were calculated for the herein used methods, the assessment based on visuzilization will be less useful. Instead, the meaningfulness of the DR methods will be discussed later in combination with diagnosis classification. The final conclusion is made when DR method is applied to the validation group based on metrics like the AUROC score. \n\nHerein, PCA and kPCA show only a moderate amount of separation in the first two dimension. Note, that there are 58 or 59 additional dimensions, respectively. So that, there is no need to display a good separation in the first two dimensions. By contrast, a sharper separation of patient groups is visible using the first two dimensions of UMAP. Similar to *t*-SNE the UC and CD patients are more intertwined with themselves than with the control group. However, the CD patients tend to mix with the healthy controls more than the UC patients with the control group. \n\nIn the following chapter, it will be assessed whether the DR methods can increase the performance of ML models.\n\n## ML Disease Classification\nHerein, several ML algorithms are used for the prediction of the patient's diagnosis. First, all three potential diagnoses are considered (multiclass classification). Then, the UC and CD patients are grouped together as IBD patients for the binary classification of sick patients (IBD) and healthy controls. \\\n\\\nBiological data are often not only high-dimensional, but also involve non-linear relationships. For example, the non-linear Michaelis-Menten model for enzyme kinectics. Therefore, it can assumed that metabolomic data also incorporates non-linear relationships. This would impair the performance of strictly linear classifiers like partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), which is often used by the metabolomics community. Therefore, non-linear classifiers like RF, support vector machines (SVM) with kernel trick, *k*-nearest neighbors algorithm (*k*-NN), and gradient boosted trees (XGBoost) will be used as comparison to the linear algorithms PLS-DA and the multinominal logistic regregression. The latter is a subtype of generalized linear models (GLM) for multiclass prediction with a logit link function.\\\n\\\nHerein, the basis for the machine learning is the `tidymodels` package. Particular, the list-column workflow (LCW) will be used, in which the `map` function of the `purrr` package and the `nest/unnest` function of the `tidyr` package are integral components. Here all objects, including dataframes, parameters, and different stages of the workflow are stored in one nested dataframe and operations like training and testing can easily be done by using the `map` function. This workflow has many advantages as keeping all data in one place, reducing code (DRY principle), and a tidy structure for easier subsequent manipulations. An interactive course for LCW can be found on [DataCamp](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/machine-learning-in-the-tidyverse) and an example with further literature recommendations [here](https://www.jwilber.me/nest/).\n\n### Multiclass prediction\nThe training of the classifiers was performed with five-fold cross-validation using the PRISM discovery group. Hyperparameter tuning was done for all models in a separate notebook and the best hyperparameters based on the AUROC score were chosen. Using the `recipe` workflow, pre-processing is easily integrated such as dummy coding or DR. DR increased the performance of only one model for the validation set, the *k*-NN classifier. Hyperparameters were also tuned for a multilayer perceptron (MLP) with one hidden layer with prior dimension reduction. The cross-validated AUROC score was 0.87, but the AUROC score for the validation set was 0.5. This means that the model poorly generalizes to unseen data. Moreover, training an MLP with high-dimensional data is not a feasible process at scale. The large input layer severely increases the weights of the network. Herein, DR was necessary for model tuning of the MLP, but training is possible on a standard notebook or cloud workspace. \n\nFor future model development, `workflowsets`of the `tidymodels` universe could be used for screening of different combinations of pre-processing methods (e.g. DR), model specifictions (e.g. random forest or knn and their specific hyperparameters).\\\n\\\nFirst, the tibble with the names of the models and the train and test data is produced.\n","metadata":{},"id":"e5acc01d-9c76-4677-833a-cc8b8de42680","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"data_ml <- tibble(classifier = c(\"RF\", \"PLSDA\", \"KNN\", \"SVM\", \"XGB\", \"GLM\"),\n                  train = list(train_df,train_df,train_df,train_df,train_df,train_df),\n                  test = list(test_df,test_df,test_df,test_df,test_df,test_df))\n","metadata":{},"id":"6522e439-a45b-401b-a799-68385cd8779f","cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"source":"Next, the models are specified with the `recipe`functions with the found hyperparameters by doing grid search using 5-fold cross-validation.

Some algorithms like random forest or gradient boosted trees have an inherent way (model-based) to quantify the relative influence of each feature. In generalized linear models and PLS-DA, the variable importance is represented by the magnitude of the standardized coefficients. Unfortunately, not all model algorithms provide model-based feature importance, e.g. KNN or SVM algorithms. However, model-agnostic interpretation methods work for every model, e.g. based on permutation. A single feature is shuffled, and the resulting change in model performance is measured, indicating how much the model relies on that feature. However, permutation-based variable importance does not reflect the intrinsic significance of the feature but how important the feature is for that particular model. Moreover, in multicollinearity cases, this method will display none of the features as necessary because other features can represent the shuffled feature. This issue could be mitigated by employing Spearman rank-order correlations with clustering and selecting only one feature from each cluster. \n\nHerein, the variable importance of only the RF, XGB and the PLSDA are considered for the sake of simplicity. The ten most important features are selected and grouped by the putative chemical class. \n","metadata":{},"id":"7df65b8c-171b-43da-9555-365682a51e24","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"vi_rf <- data_ml_fit$fitted[[1]] %>% extract_fit_parsnip() %>% vi() %>% rename(Feature=Variable)\nvi_xgb <- data_ml_fit$fitted[[5]] %>% extract_fit_parsnip() %>% vi() %>% rename(Feature=Variable)\nvi_plsda <-data_ml_fit$fitted[[2]] %>% extract_fit_parsnip() %>% tidy() %>% filter(type==\"predictors\")\n\ndf_fet <- df_met_feature %>% select(Feature = `Metabolomic Feature`, everything()) %>% as.data.frame()\ndf_fet$Feature <- str_replace(df_fet$Feature, \"-\", \".\")\n","metadata":{},"id":"976b2f28-dba8-4b74-8e7e-a5d8adde4f23","cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"source":"\n\n","metadata":{},"id":"2e1cca07-bde5-4a62-b7e1-a7aecf10e311","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"top_10_rf <- left_join(df_fet, vi_rf, by=c(\"Feature\")) %>% drop_na(c(`Putative Chemical Class`)) %>% top_n(wt=Importance, 10)\ntop_10_xgb <- left_join(df_fet, vi_xgb, by=c(\"Feature\")) %>% drop_na(c(`Putative Chemical Class`)) %>% top_n(wt=Importance, 10)\ntop_10_plsda <- left_join(df_fet, vi_plsda, by=c(\"Feature\" = \"term\")) %>% drop_na(c(`Putative Chemical Class`)) %>% top_n(wt=value, 10) %>% select(Importance = value, everything(), -type, -component)\n\ntop_30 <- rbind(top_10_rf, top_10_xgb, top_10_plsda)\n","metadata":{},"id":"d4ccc725-8847-4d94-9464-9d84171cae9f","cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"source":"\n\n","metadata":{},"id":"db6b8707-8c24-475c-a856-8050110c94a9","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"top_30 %>% count(`Putative Chemical Class`) %>% filter(n > 1) %>% ggplot(aes(x=fct_reorder(`Putative Chemical Class`, n), y=n)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(x=\"Putative chemical class\",\n       y=\"Count\")\n","metadata":{},"id":"8b65ac2f-45ea-44b5-bd2b-187c3a20776e","cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"source":"Tetrapyrrole derivatives are the most important chemical class for the prediction of the diagnosis for the three selected models. They appeared in total eight times in the ten most important features. The other features appeared at least two times in sum. Tetrapyrrole derivatives could origin from vitamin B12 or heme. Vitamin B12 could be produced by bacteria or ingested. Moreover, heme, which could originate from food or bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract could lead to gut dysbiosis. \nAlso, the alpha-branched alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone class is interesting and could potentially hint microbial (xenobiotic) metabolism. In contrast to host enzymes, which usually use oxidative and conjugative reactions, gut microbes use primarily hydrolytic and reductive methods. https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aag2770\nDue to the inherent electrophilc character of this chemical class they have the capacity to adverse and toxic effects. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15199949/\n\nThose results could be more refined with a more accurate identification of the chemical compounds. Moreover, differential abundance analysis would be an complementary method to elucidate the role of the compounds in IBD. \n\n# Conclusion\n\nAfter data wrangling and exploratory data analysis, first impressions of the difficulty of the discrimination of patients were gathered during the dimension reduction visualization. Both linear and non-linear classifiers achieved satisfactory results. This could indicate that non-linear relationships are not predominant in this case. The UC and CD patients can be grouped as IBD patients to detect sick patients with a high sensitivity.\nMore studies are required to discriminate between CD and UC patients appropriately. This could either be done by tuning classification models or finding a better LC-MS analysis method. For example, different dimension reductions are combined with a variety of classifiers and scanned using `workflowsets`. Moreover, variable importance analysis and/or differential expression analysis is performed for the binary case of CD vs UC. Then, the LC-MS method could be optimized for the predominating discriminating substance class.\n","metadata":{},"id":"3d1894a7-5cfe-4535-942b-f5e7ad0a1464","cell_type":"markdown"}],"metadata":{"anaconda-cloud":"","kernelspec":{"display_name":"R","langauge":"R","name":"ir"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":"r","file_extension":".r","mimetype":"text/x-r-source","name":"R","pygments_lexer":"r","version":"3.4.1"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
