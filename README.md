# Gut Metabolome Analysis
Inflammatory Bowel Disease Classification & Analysis based on Gut Metabolomic Data

The goal of the project is to present an analysis of clinical data by leveraging a multitude of computational approaches. The objectives of the analysis are the sensitive prediction of sick patients using machinge learning (ML) and the possible identification of new biomarkers for inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) by using the feature importance of the ML models and/or differential expression analysis.

This project is based on high-dimensional data obtained by mass spectrometry (MS). Here, different dimensionality reduction and machine learning (ML) methods will be used and discussed. The script is divided in several sections, starting with data wrangling, followed by exploratory data analysis. Different methods are used for dimension reduction with subsequent classification from a variety of ML models. Finally, the results will be discussed. Moreover, a differential expression analysis is planned. 

The analysis is published on DataCamps workspace & RPubs:
